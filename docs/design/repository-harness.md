# Repository harness

Status: **normative**  
Reference baseline: [`openai/codex@f4f85add`](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/f4f85add41288c2059dc1a4326a598f739e47fe9), inspected 2026-08-29.

This document fixes the repository shape and verification interface before product code is added. It adopts Codex's transferable harness patterns—not its Rust/Bazel technology choices: one root task interface, package-owned tests, scoped agent instructions, change-aware CI, and one aggregate required status.

Current product and architecture decisions live only in [`solution-and-roadmap.md`](solution-and-roadmap.md). Research files contain evidence that is still used by that decision source; once evidence or recommendations are superseded, merge any surviving facts and delete the stale file. Git history is the archive.

## 1. Architecture rule

A product **module** owns behavior and data behind one small **interface**. Its callers and tests cross the same **seam**. Concrete infrastructure is an **adapter** at that seam.

- Prefer a deep module over transport-, model-, or table-shaped pass-through layers.
- Dependencies point toward domain behavior. HTTP handlers, jobs, persistence, cameras, and connectors adapt to modules; modules do not import them.
- A module owns its tables and migrations. Cross-module access uses the owner's interface, never direct table reads.
- Introduce a seam when behavior actually varies. A production adapter plus a test fake is not by itself evidence that the product needs a public plugin system.
- The judgment core consumes normalized observations and returns decisions. It must not know whether an observation came from a chunk, a camera, or a connector. It runs inside the inference host (see [ADR-0005](../adr/0005-judgment-runs-inside-the-inference-host.md)) and depends only on the Python standard library, because the container's interpreter version comes from the NVIDIA base image.
- The inference host is an autonomous judgment unit: it keeps judging, latching violations, dispatching disposals, and buffering evidence while the center is unreachable. The center is the management and aggregation plane; it must never sit on the real-time error-proofing path.
- Reuse before rebuild. The NVIDIA base code is this system's trunk, not an external dependency. Where the base already implements a capability, reuse it; where it is close but insufficient, modify it in place within the recorded patch scope; build new only where the base has nothing or has coupled it too tightly to patch (see [ADR-0007](../adr/0007-base-is-the-trunk-not-a-dependency.md)). Two implementations of one capability on the same path are a defect, not a boundary: where we reimplement, the base's version must no longer be called on that path.
- Optimize for end-to-end latency and bounded queues. A successful real-time result must render in the Web UI no more than 500 ms after its start point, which differs by result type: the last source frame for arrival-time verdicts, and the moment the closing condition holds for instance-closing verdicts. Report p50/p95/p99 per class, count every over-budget result, and require zero over-budget results in the target-hardware gate.

## 2. Canonical layout

Create directories lazily when the first real file needs them; empty scaffolding is not architecture.

Reserved production application names are `control-api`, `control-web`, and `edge-runtime`. `edge-runtime` holds the judgment core and everything else that must keep working while the center is unreachable; `vendor/` carries only a minimal hook that imports and calls it, which keeps our logic under lint, type checking, and unit tests while holding the patch surface small (see [ADR-0007](../adr/0007-base-is-the-trunk-not-a-dependency.md)). Shared code enters `packages/` only after at least two real callers exist; otherwise it remains in its owning application. Root `src/` is forbidden because it erases ownership.

The center backend pins Python to 3.12 with a committed `.python-version`, one root `pyproject.toml` uv workspace, and a committed `uv.lock`; CI runs `uv sync --frozen`. `edge-runtime`'s judgment core is standard-library-only and therefore not bound to that pin: it executes inside the NVIDIA base container, whose interpreter version is set by the base image.

### Workspace manifests

When the first Python workspace lands, use one root `pyproject.toml` and committed `uv.lock`. When the web workspace lands, use a root `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and committed `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Pin runtimes and package-manager versions; CI installs from lockfiles without updating them. Do not add these manifests before a real workspace exists.

## 3. Module ownership and seams

| Module | Owns | Interface examples | Adapters live outside the behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth` | users, roles, permissions, sessions | authorize command; open/revoke session | FastAPI auth, PostgreSQL |
| `device` | inference hosts, inference backends, stations, cameras, connector configuration | resolve station topology; report health | Hikvision, board card, inference health |
| `template` | Excel validation, immutable versions, release/binding, desired-vs-reported reconciliation | import draft; release; resolve active version | workbook parser, object storage |
| `dataset` | training videos, action time-range annotation, usage checks, derived artifacts | register video; annotate ranges; run usage check; emit artifact | presigned object storage, reused annotator UI |
| `monitor` | reported mirror of SOP instances, decisions, and stream health; dashboard state | upsert reported decision; query dashboard | inference-host report endpoint |
| `alert` | archived violations and disposal records | archive violation; archive disposal result | UI notification |
| `evidence` | evidence references and human review | request clip; attach review | edge runtime, MinIO |
| `job` | durable asynchronous application commands | enqueue/query application job | ARQ/Redis |

An inference backend is one process endpoint carrying one template configuration, not one machine; a host runs as many backends as it has distinct templates, and `device_inference_host` models the machine separately. The judgment core is not a center module: it lives in `edge-runtime`, owns no tables, and stays a pure function. `monitor` holds the center-side mirror written by idempotent upserts from each inference host, so its rows are reports rather than the authority — the authority for decisions, latched violations, and disposal execution is the inference host's local SQLite.

`dataset` is separate from `template` on purpose: the glossary defines a training data set as something that does **not** define an SOP template, and lists SOP template as an avoided synonym. Merging them in code would re-fuse two concepts the language deliberately separates.

Module boundaries are enforced mechanically, not by review. Each center module is a Python package with a `usecases/` layer where authorization is enforced, and an `api.py` that exposes only the subset other modules actually call — `api.py` is the cross-module contract, not the module's full outward entry set, so a configuration module's CRUD use cases stay in `usecases/` rather than becoming pass-through re-exports. Authorization is enforced in `usecases/`, never only at the HTTP route, because jobs, report intake, and smoke scripts call the same use cases. `api.py` is the only permitted cross-module import target; `import-linter` contracts fail the gate when the judgment core imports an adapter, when a module imports past another's `api`, or when a domain layer imports `adapters/*`. Physical table names carry their owning module's prefix (`device_camera`, `template_version`, `auth_session`) so migration ownership is statically decidable. Cross-module use cases share one request-scoped Unit of Work opened and committed by the HTTP adapter layer; module facades participate but never commit. The HTTP adapter layer may compose several modules' `summary()` use cases into one aggregate response (the overview page); that composition carries no judgment logic.

`packages/contracts` contains only wire contracts used across processes (the inference-host report and pull contracts, the exported `openapi.json`) and their compatibility fixtures. It must not become a shared domain-logic bucket.

### External traffic boundary

- Nginx serves the Web application, routes center-backend HTTP traffic, and reverse-proxies the reused annotation UI and training microservices with authorization added at the gateway. It does not relay video.
- REST/JSON + OpenAPI is the control-plane contract under the fixed literal prefix `/api/v1`, which is not a version axis; see [ADR-0003](../adr/0003-api-v1-is-a-fixed-prefix.md). Each inference host reports to the center and pulls its own configuration; the center exposes normalized live updates as SSE for the dashboard only.
- Browsers connect directly to the MediaMTX instance on the assigned inference host for WebRTC signaling and media. MediaMTX is protected by the trusted factory network boundary; no per-viewer JWT/JWKS service is part of the first deployment.
- Training videos are uploaded one file at a time through presigned URLs directly to MinIO; archives are never uploaded and the backend never unpacks one. The control plane only issues the presigned URL, registers the video, and verifies it — the low-volume gateway rule stands.
- Device credentials live only on the inference host that uses them, encrypted with a key from a read-only deployment secret file (see [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-credentials-stay-on-the-inference-host.md)). The center stores a configured/not-configured flag, never ciphertext, and no center-generated artifact or download contains a secret.

## 4. Test placement and evidence

Tests belong to the module or seam whose behavior they prove:

- **Unit**: deterministic module behavior, under the owning app's `tests/unit/`; Vue component tests may be colocated as `*.spec.ts` when the component is the sole owner.
- **Integration**: one app plus real local infrastructure or one adapter, under that app's `tests/integration/`. Replace the adapter at the seam; do not mock through internal call chains.
- **Contract**: an external or inter-process interface. `tests/contract/base/` holds two families, both mandatory after every subtree update: assertions that base behavior we depend on but do not change is still true, and assertions that our recorded patches still apply and behave correctly.
- **System**: user-visible flows across applications, black-box through published interfaces.
- **Performance/hardware**: explicit suites, never hidden in unit tests. Record hardware, model/digest, data set, p50/p95/p99, queue depth, and pass budget.

Every bug fix starts with the narrowest regression test that fails for the observed behavior. Safety invariants require tests at the judgment core's interface, especially that invalid observation periods never become a false failure verdict. The rework sequence `1,2,3,2,4,5` must be judged compliant: the base heuristic reports it as two separate violations, so this is the first regression test the judgment core has to pass and the sharpest line between our behavior and the base's.

Fixtures must be synthetic or sanitized, minimal, deterministic, and documented with provenance. Customer video, credentials, model weights, and production exports are never fixtures.

## 5. Stable command interface

`make check` is the CPU-only, infrastructure-free merge gate and must work from the repository root, without Docker. CI calls it exactly as developers do. Today it runs repository policy checks; each workspace-adding change must extend it in the same change with that workspace's formatting, lint, type, unit, contract, and build checks, plus the boundary checks (`import-linter` contracts, migration table-ownership, generated-artifact cleanliness).

`make check-integration` is the second required target: one application plus real local infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO) started as containers via testcontainers. It is separate because a developer without Docker must still be able to run `make check`, and because container startup does not belong in the fast feedback loop. Both targets feed the blocking gatherer, so merge protection strength is unchanged. SQLite and in-memory fakes are not substitutes for the integration target: transaction isolation, `JSONB`, timezone, and deferred foreign key behavior differ enough to produce false green.

Package-specific commands may exist for a tight feedback loop, but they do not replace these two targets. Automation in `scripts/` stays thin: product behavior belongs in an app or package where it can be tested through its interface.

## 6. CI gates

### Blocking pull-request gate

The sole branch-protection status is `CI required` from `.github/workflows/blocking-ci.yml`. The gatherer runs with `always()` and fails if any required dependency fails or is cancelled. This prevents a skipped downstream job from appearing green.

As workspaces appear, split checks into reusable workflows while retaining the gatherer:

1. repository policy and lockfile cleanliness — always;
2. backend/edge format, lint, type, unit, boundary, and base-code contract checks (`make check`) — on relevant paths;
3. backend integration checks against real containerized infrastructure (`make check-integration`) — on relevant paths;
4. web format, lint, type, unit, and production build — on relevant paths;
5. migration and cross-process contract compatibility — when schemas or contracts change;
6. workflow changes — run every blocking family.

Path filtering is an optimization, not an exemption: every reusable workflow must return an explicit success when no relevant files changed. Actions are pinned to immutable commit SHAs, permissions are least-privilege, dependency installs are frozen, jobs have timeouts, and cancellation is enabled for superseded PR runs.

### Non-blocking and release gates

GPU, camera, connector, multi-stream, 72-hour, and 7-day suites run on labeled self-hosted runners by manual dispatch or schedule. They publish evidence and never silently fall back to mocks. Release promotion additionally requires SBOM/license review, image and dependency scanning, migration/rollback rehearsal, offline-start verification, and immutable image/model digests.

## 7. Inherited base code and generated artifacts

`vendor/sop-monitoring-blueprints/` is the NVIDIA base code, this system's trunk. It changes only through a dedicated `git subtree pull` or a recorded replayable patch within the scope fixed by [ADR-0007](../adr/0007-base-is-the-trunk-not-a-dependency.md): two patches, each of which only adds output — the pipeline message callback that surfaces stream-health events, and the disposal actions. Sequence comparison and boundary solving are reimplemented in `apps/edge-runtime/` rather than patched, because the base interleaves boundary detection with sequence comparison inside one method; `vendor/` therefore carries no patch for them. Everything else stays as delivered; capabilities the base already provides are reused rather than rebuilt. Patch logic lives in `apps/edge-runtime/` with only a minimal hook inside `vendor/`, so the patch surface stays small and our code remains testable. The update change records the NVIDIA commit in [`docs/base/verified-commits.md`](../base/verified-commits.md) and runs all tests in `tests/contract/base/`.

Generated clients, schemas, and deployment output must have one documented source command. CI regenerates and checks a clean worktree. Commit generated output only when consumers cannot generate it during install or build.

## 8. Agent instruction hierarchy

The root `AGENTS.md` stays short and points here for layout work. Add a nested `AGENTS.md` only when a real subtree needs local commands or exceptions; the nearest file refines root rules. Keep each rule in one source of truth rather than copying this document into agent files.

## 9. Codex patterns used

- Root instructions plus rare local refinement: [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/f4f85add41288c2059dc1a4326a598f739e47fe9/AGENTS.md) and a nested TUI instruction file.
- One task interface shared by humans and automation: [`justfile`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/f4f85add41288c2059dc1a4326a598f739e47fe9/justfile).
- Package-owned integration suites: [`codex-rs/core/tests`](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/f4f85add41288c2059dc1a4326a598f739e47fe9/codex-rs/core/tests).
- Reusable checks aggregated into one required result: [`blocking-ci.yml`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/f4f85add41288c2059dc1a4326a598f739e47fe9/.github/workflows/blocking-ci.yml).
- Change detection with a required gatherer and explicit no-change success: [`rust-ci.yml`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/f4f85add41288c2059dc1a4326a598f739e47fe9/.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml).
- Repository-specific invariant checks and clean-worktree verification: [`repo-checks.yml`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/f4f85add41288c2059dc1a4326a598f739e47fe9/.github/workflows/repo-checks.yml).
